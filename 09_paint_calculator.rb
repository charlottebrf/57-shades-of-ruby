# Calculate gallons of paint needed to paint the ceiling of a room.
# Prompt for the length and width, and assume one gallon covers 350 square feet.
# Display the number of gallons needed to paint the ceiling as a whole number.
#
# Example Output
#        You will need to purchase 2 gallons of
#        paint to cover 360 square feet.
# Remember, you can’t buy a partial gallon of paint. You must round up to the next whole gallon.
# Constraints
# • Use a constant to hold the conversion rate.
# • Ensure that you round up to the next whole number.

#calculate area of ceiling
#length * width

#calculate area in feet

#calculate gallons needed
#area in feet / 360
#result * 2

#displays gallons of paint needed(number_of_gallons, area_square_feet)
#puts "You will need to purchase #{number_of_gallons} gallons of paint to cover #{area_square_feet)} square feet."
