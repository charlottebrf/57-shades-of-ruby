#Problem: create a program that determines how many years you have left until retirement & the year you can retire. It should prompt you for your current age & the age you want to retire & display the output as shown in the example that follows.

#Example output:
What is your current age? 25
At what age would you like to retire? 65
You have 40 years left until you can retire.
It's 2015, so you can retire in 2055.

Constraints:
-Again be sure to convert the input to numerical data before doing any math.
-Don't hard-code the current year into your program. Get it from the system via your programming language.
